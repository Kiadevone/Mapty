# üó∫Ô∏è Mapty ‚Äî Workout Tracker App

A sleek and interactive workout tracker built with **JavaScript ES6 classes** and **Leaflet.js**, allowing users to log and visualize their running or cycling workouts on a map.

This project was built as a hands-on practice from the [Complete JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by **Jonas Schmedtmann**, and refined with my own touch to improve structure, UI, and real-world logic implementation.
